# Cooper Pair Box

A cooper pair box is a simple realisation of a charge qubit.  It is created using the
super conductve properties of materials.  This jupyter notebook demonstrates how to
calculate the hamiltonian of a cooper pair box and will then solve for the eigen 
values of this hamiltonian.  The resultant energy levels calculated are then plotted.

This jupyter notebook has been made interactive and the charging energy and the 
Josephson (tunnelling) energy can be changed in real time using sliders.
