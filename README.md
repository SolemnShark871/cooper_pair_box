# Cooper Pair Box

A cooper pair box is a simple realisation of a charge qubit.  It is created using the
superconductive properties of materials.  This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to
calculate the Hamiltonian of a cooper pair box and will then solve for the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.  The resultant energy levels calculated are then plotted.

This Jupyter notebook has been made interactive- the charging energy and the 
Josephson (tunnelling) energy can be changed in real time using sliders.
